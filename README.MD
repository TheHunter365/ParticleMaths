ParticleMaths
=============

this is a small plugin spigot to display parametric equations of mathematical curves in 2 and 3 dimensions with particles

Adding new particle
-------------------

create a new json file called as the mathematical curve name in curves folder !

example:
````json
{
  "duration": 1200,
  "loopPerTicks": 8,
  "timeIncrement": 3.14,
  "equationX": "WIP",
  "equationY": "WIP",
  "equationZ": "WIP"
}
````
And enjoy you new particle effect displaying the beauty of Maths :)
